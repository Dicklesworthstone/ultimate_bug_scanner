# Ruby UBS Samples

- Buggy scripts demonstrate eval usage, unsafe YAML load, thread leaks, and shell injection.
- Clean scripts show context managers, Open3 argv arrays, and frozen string literals.
- Run `ubs test-suite/ruby/buggy` vs `ubs test-suite/ruby/clean` once the Ruby module is enabled in automation.
